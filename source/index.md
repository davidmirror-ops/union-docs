# Introduction

Union is a workflow orchestration platform based on the Flyte open-source project hosted by Union in your cloud account.

Flyte is already used by hundreds of major organizations to run machine learning and data pipelines.
However, it does require platform engineers to maintain, extend, and scale.

Union abstracts away the required infrastructure, providing a turnkey platform that lets your ML engineers and data scientists focus on what they do best.
