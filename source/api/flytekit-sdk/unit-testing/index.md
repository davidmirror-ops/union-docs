# Unit testing

The decorator and function documented below will help you unit test your Flyte tasks. They are particularly helpful for testing workflows that contain tasks that cannot run locally.

```{eval-rst}

.. currentmodule:: flytekit.testing

.. autosummary::
   :template: custom.rst
   :toctree: members/

   patch
   task_mock
```
