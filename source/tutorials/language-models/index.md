# Language Models

Language models (LMs) are a type of deep learning model that fundamentally predicts
tokens within some context window, either in a [masked](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/tasks/masked_language_modeling) or
[causal](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/tasks/language_modeling) manner.

Large language models (LLMs) are a type of language model that have many trainable 
parameters, which in recent times can be hundreds of millions to trillions of parameters.

In these examples, you'll learn how to use LMs of different sizes for different
use cases, from sentiment analysis to text generation.
