# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing computer systems that can learn and adapt without explicitly being programmed. Instead of following rigid rules, these systems learn from data and improve their performance over time.

In these examples, you'll learn how to use Union for machine learning applications.
