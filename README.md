# Union.ai Docs Builder

**[union.ai/docs](https://union.ai/docs)**

This repository builds and publishes all Union.ai documentation.

The site is _automatically published_ when the PR targeting `main` branch is merged.

Details on how to author, build and publish the docs can be found on the website itself at [Contributing docs and examples](https://union.ai/docs/community/contributing-docs).

The source code for that section can be found in this repository under `content/community/contricbuting-docs/`.
