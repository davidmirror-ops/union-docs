# Community

Flyte is an open source project that is built and maintained by a community of contributors.
Union AI is the primary maintainer of Flyte and developer of Union, a closed source commercial product that is built on top of Flyte.

Union AI is dedicated to building and expanding the Flyte open source project and the community around it.


## Contributing to the codebase

The full Flyte codebase is open source and available on GitHub.
If you are interested, see the [Contributing code](./contributing-code) section.


## Contributing to documentation

Union AI maintains and hosts both Flyte and Union documentation at [www.union.ai/docs](https://www.union.ai/docs).
The two sets of documentaion are deeply integrated, as the Union product is built on top of Flyte.
To better maintain both sets of docs, they are hosted in the same repository (but rendered so that you can choose to view one or the other).

Both the Flyte and Union documentation are open source.
Flyte community members and Union customers are both welcome to contribute to the documentation.

If you are interested, see the [Contributing documentation and examples](./contributing-docs) section.
